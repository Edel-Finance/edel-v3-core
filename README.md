# Edel Protocol

This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for Edel Protocol. The repository uses Docker Compose and Hardhat as development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## What is Edel?

Edel is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
